# Devlog: Pot Interaction System üè∫

I initially created the heart entity, which wasn't too complicated since I was becoming familiar with the workflow - it didn't take long to complete the heart requirements. However, what started as simply "create a pot object" became a complex system touching state management, collision detection, and visual polish across the entire game.

**The Challenge:** Building interactive objects that feel natural required rethinking core systems. The existing sprite animations couldn't handle lifting mechanics, so it took me some time to realize I needed custom sprite loading with precise coordinate mapping for player poses.

**State Machine Evolution:** Carrying objects needed dedicated states. Since I didn't take advantage of the State Diagram initially, I started off on the wrong foot by handling CarryIdling and CarryWalking together in one state. This cost me time until I read the hints more carefully and discovered it was better to have two separate states. The breakthrough was creating `CarryingIdle` and `CarryingWalking` states that mirror the existing `Idle/Walking` pattern. This felt obvious in retrospect but took several iterations to discover.

**Object Placement:** I chose to handle object overlap prevention at the end of the implementation. I solved this by finding valid positions through iterative collision checking (50 attempts max) against existing objects.

As I've solved and implemented different features, I can now figure out solutions more effectively. However, managing state and collision systems still takes me considerable time to fully understand and implement correctly. I use AI as an assistant and personal tutor to help verify my approach to certain problems after implementing solutions myself.
